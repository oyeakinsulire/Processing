#  Week 9 - Vectors and Motion/Brick_Game
An implementation of a classic Brick Game, focusing on the use of vectors for managing motion, physics, and collisions of game elements.

Requirements
Written in Processing 4.3 or higher.
No special libraries required.
Operation
Run the main .pde file within the Week 9 - Vectors and Motion/Brick_Game directory in Processing.
