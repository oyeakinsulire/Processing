#Week 7 - Algorithmic Music and Sampling
This project explores the creation of music through algorithms and the use of sampling techniques within Processing.

Requirements
Written in Processing 4.3 or higher.
Requires a sound library (e.g., minim, sound) for audio playback.
Any sample audio files should be in a data subdirectory.
Operation
Run the main .pde file within the Week 7 - Algorithmic Music and Sampling directory in Processing.

Design notes
The aim was to generate musical patterns and structures using code. This involved designing simple compositional rules and integrating pre-recorded audio samples to create unique soundscapes.
