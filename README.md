# Processing Portfolio


This repository showcases a collection of interactive sketches and projects developed using Processing. Each week's work is organized into a dedicated directory, demonstrating various concepts and techniques in creative coding.

Repository Structure
Each week's task is stored in its own directory, named descriptively. Inside each weekly directory, you'll find a README.md file with a description of the sketch, operational details, and a visual representation (screenshot or video link).
