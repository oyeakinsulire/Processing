# Week 6 - Digital Sound and Oscillation
Experiments with generating digital sound, understanding oscillation principles, and implementing frequency modulation (FM) synthesis.

Requirements
Written in Processing 4.3 or higher.
Requires a sound library (e.g., minim, sound) for audio output.
Operation
Run the main .pde file within the Week 6 -Digital Sound and Oscillation/Freq_Mod directory in Processing.

Design notes
This week was an introduction to algorithmic sound design. Challenges included accurately generating waveforms and understanding the parameters that influence pitch, timbre, and amplitude through code.
